# AlgebraicCollisionKeccakSmall100
Proof of Concept for the paper intitled "Algebraic Collisions on Keccak" published at ToSC 2021 (Issue 1)

This code can really be optimized, but it is necessary to verify the theory inside the paper mentioned above. 

Credits are to Rachelle Heim-Boissier and Yann Rotella

Contact Us if you have insights on the paper and ideas to improve the attack it would be a great improvement to have a 3-round attack on Keccak[200] and Keccak[400].
